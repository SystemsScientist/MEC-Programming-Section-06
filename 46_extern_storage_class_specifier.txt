	the global variable, which is defined outside the
	scope of a file

	during the function call, when the function is
	defined outside the scope of the file

	The keyword 'extern' is relevant only when your
	project consists of multiple files, and you need
	to access a variable defined in one file from 
	another file

	'extern' keyword is used to extend the visibility
	of a function or variable
