Section 06: Storage Class Specifiers in C
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Storage Class in 'C' Language decides

	- Scope of a variable

	- Visibility of a variable or function

	- Life time of a variable


Scope, visibility, and lifetime are features of a variable.
These features can be modified by using storage class
specifiers


Storage Class Specifiers in 'C'

There are two widely used storage class specifiers in 'C'

	- static

	- extern


We want a global variable that is private to a fuction.
We want a private variable that does not lose its
existence even if the execution control goes out of
the scope of that variable.
