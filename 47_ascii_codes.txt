ASCII Codes

	- The American National Standards Institute
	  (ANSI), which developed ANSI C, also developed
	  the ASCII codes

	- ASCII stands for "American Standard Code for
	  Information Interchange"

	- By using ASCII standard, you can encode 128
	  different characters
	
	- That's why to encode any ASCII character, you
	  just need 7 bits (you can use char data type)
